* Is the GCC or IBM C calling convention being used?
*
         GBLC &COMP               Declare compiler switch
*
* What system are the compiles being done for?
*
         GBLC &ZSYS               Declare variable for system
*
* Do we want to support environments like MVS/XA needing step down?
*
         GBLC &STEPD              Declare variable for step-down
*
* Which OS are we targetting?
*

*
* Are PUTs done in locate or move mode?

*
&COMP    SETC 'GCC'               Indicate that this is for GCC
* &COMP    SETC 'IBMC'            Indicate that this is for IBM C
&ZSYS    SETC 'S370'              Define either S370, S380 or S390
&STEPD   SETC 'NO'                Indicate we don't want to step down
&OUTM    SETC 'M'                 Indicate move mode

* &OS      SETC 'MUSIC'           Indicate that this is for MUSIC/SP
*
* AMODE/RMODE not available on S370. In the S/370 model,
